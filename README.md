Course Title: Machine Learning

Instructor: Andrew Ng

University: Stanford, Computer Science Department

Delivered by: Coursera



This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 

Topics include: 

* Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 

* Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 

* Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 

The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building:

* smart robots (perception, control)

* text understanding (web search, anti-spam)

* computer vision

* medical informatics

* audio

* database mining
